			<h4>I'll think of something to put here.</h4>
			<p>I've been paying for hosting for a long time now and really don't have the energy or interest to maintain a blog correctly, so I've decided to use this site to host a few things, including, but not limited to - </p>
			<ul>
				<li>My portfolio</li>
				<li>Details on myself</li>
			</ul>

		<h4>About this site</h4>
		Deleting an old &amp; under-maintained, but otherwise functional website before you've even sketched out the replacement could be thought of as impulsive. I just call it &quot;forcing my hand&quot;.
